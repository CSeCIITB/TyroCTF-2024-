# Wire-HTTPS

### Problem Statement
- nyancat captured network traffice to get the secret to unlock forbidden door. But the problem is, it is encrypted. No worries a trusted source also gave some keys in the form of ssl-key logs. See how to use it and get the secret from the trace.

## Solution
- Given sslkey.log file, decrypt the https traffic using wireshark. Find the trace for secret.png file, and export it.
